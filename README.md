## üìëProject 1: Philosophical Text Recommender System (Project for [Fuse.com](https://desenv.fuse.online/))
Code source [here](https://github.com/JeanLucaSchindler/FUSE_Recommendations)!

**Overview:**
This project involved the summarization of over 2000 philosophical texts using the OpenAI API and the development of a recommendation system based on the summarized content.
#### Test out yourself at [Fuse.com](https://desenv.fuse.online/)!

    <img src="FUSE.png">
</p>


**Methodology:**
- **Text Summarization:** I utilized the OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model to generate concise summaries of lengthy philosophical texts. The model was fine-tuned to produce summaries optimized for embedding and vectorization, making them ideal for use in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The summarized texts were preprocessed through tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and other standard NLP techniques to prepare the data for vectorization.
- **Recommender System:** A CountVectorizer was applied to the cleaned text data, followed by Truncated SVD for dimensionality reduction. Cosine similarity was then used to identify the most similar texts, providing personalized recommendations based on the input text.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini)
- Python (Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Cosine Similarity

**Key Results:**
- Successfully generated high-quality text summaries.
- Developed a content-based recommendation system with efficient similarity computations, delivering accurate recommendations based on the user's input.

## üôéüèΩProject 2: Facial Emotion Recognition
Code source [here](https://github.com/JeanLucaSchindler/FER)!

**Overview:**
This project focuses on real-time facial emotion recognition using a combination of face detection technology and a custom-trained deep learning model.

#### Test out yourself on my [Streamlit Website](https://ferapp-axbsyhiuzlz2gvtrscjuj5.streamlit.app/)!
<p align="center">
    <img src="output.gif">
</p>

**Methodology:**
- **Face Detection:** Utilized Mediapipe for robust and efficient face detection in real-time video streams.
- **Emotion Classification Model:** Trained an Inception-ResNet-V2 model on a subsample of the AffectNet dataset, which includes 28,000 images labeled with 8 different emotions. The model achieved a test accuracy of 70%.
- **Model Comparison:** Prior to selecting Inception-ResNet-V2, I experimented with a custom CNN and ResNet50V2, achieving lower accuracies of 40% and 63% respectively.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- Python (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV)
- Mediapipe for Face Detection
- Inception-ResNet-V2 Architecture
